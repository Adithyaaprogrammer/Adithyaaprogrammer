1. The Main goal maximize the performance of the N-BEATS algorithm in predicting the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency data
2. Normalization of the dataset was done to maintain consistent value ranges ensuring it is optimally structured.
3. Daily OHLCV(Open-High-Low-Close-Volume) data of Bitcoin in csv format is used for the training and testing of the
